Linear Regression Model for Predicting Sale Prices
This project implements a linear regression model to predict sale prices based on input features from a dataset. It includes data preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling. The model is trained using scikit-learn and evaluated with metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and RÂ². Visualizations, including scatterplots of actual vs. predicted values and residual distributions, provide insights into the model's performance. The trained model is saved as a .pkl file for future use. This project is ideal for understanding linear regression fundamentals and practical implementation.
